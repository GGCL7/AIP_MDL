# Welcome to: Predicting anti-inflammatory peptides by ensemble machine learning and deep learning
This AIP prediction tool developed by a team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)

We provided our dataset and you can find them [Dataset](https://github.com/GGCL7/AIP_MDL/tree/main/Dataset)

We developed three models, and you can find the pre-stored models at [Model](https://github.com/GGCL7/AIP_MDL/tree/main/Model).
